This is nfd's blog. You can reach me at [nfd@nfd.moe](mailto:nfd@nfd.moe),
or [business@nfd.moe](mailto:business@nfd.moe) if you're more interested
in hiring me to do something.
You can also contact me at @nfd@cybre.space on Matrix.
(Email's probably the way to go if you need me in a pinch.)

I'm a software generalist with a computer science background.
I'm also an "amateur [eschatologist](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eschatology),"
a tongue-in-cheek term I made up.
I study various social issues in my spare time,
and sometimes condense my notes and annotations into posts here.
