Like many of my best stories, all of my love stories pivotally involve buses.

Now, normally, "I love you" ought to read like 
"my investment in us-as-a-unit continues to be worth it."
I'm going to go ahead and take another angle on the topic.
Call it a fun little retrospective 
[at the end of a year that left everyone too cooped-up to have so many of these interactions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)

Once, I was on a municipal bus ride to school (community college),
sat on one of the inward-facing bench seats as is my wont,
and I met the eye of someone sitting across from me,
and again, and again, and we'd warmly smiled to each other each time.
Not a word was exchanged.
Maybe, rounding up, I think I fell a fifth of a percent in love. 
Over that ten minutes, we did so much as negotiate a relationship,
its terms,
performed our roles,
and ended it precisely on schedule.
(The bus was on-time that morning.)
I don't think I ever saw them again, 
and it's been enough years that I'll never know.

A good while later (probably a bit under three years?),
I'd sat on my late commuter bus home from a semi-routine trip 
a couple hours' ride away to see a partner.
This one's about my seat-neighbor for the next couple hours of my life.

She has earrings made of plastic goldfish.
She drops a pocket full of coins on the floor
(which I quietly help sweep up in a less-perfunctory-than-normal sort of way).
I attempt to try to do a small amount of work for a few minutes,
but I couldn't get either the bus's terrible network or
my phone's tether to work well enough to get anything done, 
so I mutter something about how computers are terrible and put the machine away.
Her phone dies.
I offer her my relevant cable.
She pulls a case of audio cassettes out of her bag,
and a cassette player, and listens to something for a good while.
Later, whatever circumstance came about,
and we talk a little.
I discuss my partner, and she effortlessly and tactfully indicated that
she was aware of some of the ambiguous queerness I'd dangled.

I haven't seen her again either;
I forget if we did so much as exchange names
(though I guess I'd *accept* a correction).
I like to think I fell one percent in love.

Now, this is all poetic metaphor or whatever.
Take that "one percent" for what it is.
Real,
hardly hyperbolic,
and a little bit unforgettable.

I have been more than one percent in love before,
and I will say it's an experience against which
one-percent-in-love might try to hold a candle,
but it's as if it's in a gale. 
Trust me,
I've written proportionally far more love letters
(destined to be read by their subjects or no)
to the more-than-one-percent cases than I did to
these two near-one-percent ones I described here.
(I did also handwrite this love letter before
typing it up: it's how I write the rest.)
Why this piece, then?

Falling in love can leave you with little traumas,
neuroses,
fox-and-sour-grapes memories, and et cetera:
those can color your recollection of the small joys
or critical little moments in a relationship that I'm
trying to gesture at here. 
One-percent-loves have the extra marginal benefit of
being loves whose memories are as about as likely to be
corrupted by new experiences as a snowball is to be found in Hell.
So long as they're ended gracefully then and there, anyway!
I've never had a love that did not start at a simple one percent.
